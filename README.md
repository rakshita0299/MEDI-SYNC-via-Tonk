## üß™ Methodology
---
### 1. **Architecture and Design**
- Built using Tonk‚Äôs modular micro-app framework.
- Each app performs specific roles while communicating over secure channels.

### 2. **Mini-App Breakdown**

#### üó£Ô∏è **Doctor-Patient Communication App**
- Doctors and patients exchange reports and scans.
- AI pipeline is triggered upon upload:
  - **U-Net model** performs segmentation on medical images (e.g., MRI, dermoscopic images).
  - **Transformer-based NLP model** analyzes medical reports to summarize findings.

#### üî¨ **LabLink App**
- Labs upload test results and imaging scans.
- Automatically processed via:
  - **U-Net** for identifying tumors or lesions.
  - **NLP** for report abstraction.

#### üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Specialist Review Module**
- Specialists can review AI-analyzed data and add insights.
- Facilitates multi-expert opinion with intelligent recommendations.

### 3. **AI Model Integration**
- **U-Net (Convolutional Neural Network architecture)**:
  - Applied to segment skin lesions and brain tumors in medical imaging.
- **Transformer/NLP-based models**:
  - Analyze unstructured text from lab reports.
  - Highlight anomalies and key metrics.

### 4. **Security & Compliance**
- Data exchange is encrypted.
- Compliant with healthcare data privacy standards (e.g., HIPAA/GDPR as applicable).
